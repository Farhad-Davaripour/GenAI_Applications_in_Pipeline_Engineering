### Is it Legal to Use ALA Material in a RAG Application

In my efforts to utilize the "Guidelines for the Design of Buried Steel Pipe" from the American Lifelines Alliance (ALA) for educational purposes in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, I have undertaken due diligence to ensure compliance. The document is publicly accessible from [this link](https://www.americanlifelinesalliance.com/pdf/Update061305.pdf) and allows for accessibility permissions. Although RAG is a nuanced assistive technology, it likely falls under tools to improve accessibility. Despite attempts to contact the ALA for explicit permission (emails returned as undeliverable), I understand that using this publicly accessible document for non-commercial educational purposes aligns with fair use principles. I remain committed to complying with any future requests from the document's stakeholders.
