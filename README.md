# CSA-Z662 Pipe Design Standard Assistant

[![Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://genai-applications-in-pipeline-engineering.streamlit.app/).

This Streamlit application assists users in retrieving specific information from the CSA Z662 pipe design standard and performing calculations related to pipeline engineering. The app leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the OpenAI model for question answering and contextual information retrieval.
